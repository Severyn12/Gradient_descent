# Gradient descent algorithm

## Project description
Shows the real work work of gradient descent algorithm by estimating the values of linear regressions coefficients. 

## Project aim
To test how algorithm works with real data.

## Data
In this project was used Wooldridge dataset 'wage1', which is in public access. More information can be found about him by this [link](http://fmwww.bc.edu/ec-p/data/wooldridge/datasets.list.html)

## Preinstallations
<code>pip install wooldridge</code>
